Developed using a stack of cutting-edge technologies, Virtual Medico offers a secure, user-friendly platform for patients to seek medical advice remotely and for healthcare professionals to provide consultations efficiently.

Key Features:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Patients and healthcare professionals can register for accounts securely and log in using Spring Security. User authentication ensures data privacy and security throughout the platform.
2. Appointment Scheduling: Patients can schedule virtual appointments with healthcare professionals based on availability. The application manages appointment slots and sends notifications to both parties to confirm appointment details.
3. Medical Profile Management: Patients can create and manage their medical profiles, including personal information, medical history, and insurance details. Healthcare professionals can access patient profiles to provide personalized medical advice.
4. Virtual Consultations: The application supports real-time video or text-based consultations between patients and healthcare professionals. Integrated communication tools enable seamless interaction and information exchange during consultations.
5. Prescription Management: Healthcare professionals can generate electronic prescriptions for patients during virtual consultations. Prescriptions are securely stored within the system and can be accessed by patients for medication procurement.
6. Medical Records Management: Virtual Medico maintains electronic medical records (EMRs) for patients, including consultation history, prescriptions, and diagnostic reports. Patients and healthcare professionals can access and update medical records as needed.
7. Responsive Design: Virtual Medico features a responsive design implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring optimal user experience across desktop and mobile devices. Patients and healthcare professionals can access the platform from any location with internet connectivity.
8. Unit Testing: JUnit testing is implemented to validate the functionality and reliability of critical components within the application, including appointment scheduling, consultation management, and payment processing.
9. MVC Architecture: The application architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, separating the presentation layer, business logic, and data access components. This architectural design promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
